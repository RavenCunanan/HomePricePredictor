# Home Price Predictor

This project uses a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on their size (square footage). By analyzing a dataset of house sizes and prices, the model provides estimated prices for unseen data.

Features:
* Linear regression model for house price prediction.
* Visualization of data and prediction results.
* Simple, easy-to-understand code for educational purposes.

  
How It Works:
1. Data Loading: The dataset includes house sizes (in square feet) and corresponding prices.
2. Data Splitting: The data is split into training and testing sets.
3. Model Training: A linear regression model is trained using the house size as the input feature.
4. Prediction: The model predicts house prices for the test set.
5. Visualization: Actual vs. predicted prices are visualized in a graph.
